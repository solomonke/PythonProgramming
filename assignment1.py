# Algorithm - a step by step procedure of completing a given task

# Simple Interest

# 1. Store value of principle on variable
# 2. Store the value of rate on a variable
# 3. Store the value of time
# 4. Store value of interest
# Interest = (principle * rate * time)/100
# Output the value of interest

# principle = 70000
# rate = 6
# time = 7
# interest = (principle * rate * time)/100
# print("The interest is :", interest)


# Generating user input
# principle = int(input("Enter principle: "))
# rate = int(input("Enter rate: "))
# time = int(input("Enter time: "))
# interest = (principle * rate * time)/100
# print("The Interest is: ", interest)

# Assignment One
# Using above concepts write a code that will prompt the user to enter amount in dollars then perform forex conversion to Kenya shillings
# Exchange rate is 120

# dollar_amount = int(input("Enter amount in dollars: "))
# conversion = dollar_amount * 120
# print("Amount in Kenya Shillings is: ", conversion)

# Assignment Two
# Write code to calculate the area of a cylinder generating dimensions from the user

# PI * r**2 * H

# radius = int(input("Enter radius: "))
# height = int(input("Enter height: "))
# PI = 3.14
# volume_of_cylinder = PI * radius ** 2 * height
# print("The volume of the cylinder is: ", volume_of_cylinder)

# Code to calculate BMI
# You need weight in KGs, height in Meters, and BMI = weight/(height ** 2)
weight = float(input("Enter weight in Kgs: "))
height = float(input("Enter height in meters: "))
bmi = weight /(height ** 2)
print("Your BMI is: ", bmi)
